```markdown
The flashcard App is created with the intention of allowing a user to answer questions based of history and systems have been implemented for the user to answer said questions as well review their scores.

## Design Considerations

The design of the **[Meal Suggestion App]** was based on the following key considerations:

1. **User Experience (UX)**: The app was designed with the goal of providing an intuitive and easy-to-navigate user interface, ensuring a seamless user experience.
   
2. **Responsiveness**: The app was built to ensure it performs well on different screen sizes, with particular attention to device compatibility.
   
3. **Simplicity**: The design is minimalistic, focusing on core features without overwhelming the user.
   
4. **Performance**: Code optimization was considered to ensure fast response times and low battery usage.
```


```markdown
## GitHub and GitHub Actions

This project was managed using **GitHub** for version control, where all code changes were committed and pushed regularly. GitHub enabled collaborative coding, allowing me to keep track of changes and maintain project integrity.

### GitHub Actions:
I utilized **GitHub Actions** to automate the build and deployment process. This includes:

- Running automated **tests** to ensure the app’s functionality.
- Compiling the app into **APK** and **AAB** files, which are the formats required for distribution.
- Uploading these build artifacts to GitHub for easy access.

The workflow ensures that my project is automatically built and tested every time I push changes, and it simplifies the process of delivering the final APK/AAB files for submission.

7. Challenges and Learnings
---------------------------

```markdown
## Challenges and Learnings

During the development of this project, I encountered several challenges, including:

1. **Challenge 1**: [Implementing the if else function"]
   - **Solution**: [I used Chatgpt and online books to help with the implementing of the if else function"]
   
2. **Challenge 2**: [The error codes kept appearing"]
   - **Solution**: [Changed the layout and the code on which fixed the erreors"]

From these challenges, I learned important lessons in debugging, using version control, and automating build processes with GitHub Actions.
```


8. Future Enhancements
----------------------

```markdown
## Future Enhancements

While the current version of the app provides the core functionality, there are several features that could be added in the future, including:

1. *[The ability or availability that allows a user to pick thier own foods from a drop down list"]
2. *[A user is able to input not just time but also a day or date]
3. *[Allowing the app to be used on all mobile devices e.g. ios, android, huawei"]

These enhancements would improve the app’s usability and make it even more versatile for end-users.

11. Disclosure of AI Usage in My Assessment
-------------------------------------------

```markdown
In the development of this project, I have used generative AI tools to assist in various parts of the assignment. Below is a detailed disclosure of where and how these tools were used:

- **Question 2.2**: Used AI for brainstorming ideas for the app's features.
- **Part 5**: Assisted in creating code snippets for setting up GitHub Actions workflows.

### 2. AI Tool(s) Used:**
- **ChatGPT** (OpenAI)

### 3. **Purpose/Intention Behind Use:**
- **Brainstorming**: Used ChatGPT to generate ideas for the app’s features and functionality.
- **Meaning Making**: Used AI to clarify some concepts and gain a better understanding of how certain technologies (e.g., GitHub Actions) work.
- **Code Assistance**: GitHub Copilot was used to assist in writing specific parts of the code, such as setting up GitHub Actions and working with Gradle.

### 4. **Date(s) in Which Generative AI Was Used:**
-  AI used on **March 28, 2025** for brainstorming feature ideas.
-  AI used on **April 1, 2025** to help set up GitHub Actions.

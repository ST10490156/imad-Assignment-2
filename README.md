```markdown
The flashcard App is created with the intention of allowing a user to answer questions based of history and systems have been implemented for the user to answer said questions as well review their scores.

 Design Considerations

The design of the Flashcard App was based on the following key considerations:
 
1. Simplicity: The design is minimalistic, focusing on core features without overwhelming the user.
   
2. Performance: Code optimization was considered to ensure fast response times and low battery usage.

## GitHub and GitHub Actions

This project was managed using **GitHub** for version control, where all code changes were committed and pushed regularly. GitHub enabled collaborative coding, allowing me to keep track of changes and maintain project integrity.

### GitHub Actions:
I utilized **GitHub Actions** to automate the build and deployment process. This includes:

- Running automated **tests** to ensure the app’s functionality.
- Compiling the app into **APK** and **AAB** files, which are the formats required for distribution.
- Uploading these build artifacts to GitHub for easy access.

The workflow ensures that my project is automatically built and tested every time I push changes, and it simplifies the process of delivering the final APK/AAB files for submission.
